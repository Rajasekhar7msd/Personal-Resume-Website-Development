            As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science 
& Engineering, I am eager to embark on a dynamic career journey where I can 
leverage my academic foundation, innovative mindset, and passion <br> for the 
technical field to contribute meaningfully to a progressive organization.  
     
            With a solid understanding of Programming Languages and Tools, 
honed through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, <br> I am poised to 
apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges. 
     
            I have experience with: 
            <ul style="color: brown; justify-content: center; position: 
relative; left: 30px;"> 
                <li>Java, C++, Python, JavaScript</li> 
                <li>Database Management Systems (SQL, NoSQL)</li> 
                <li>Web Development (HTML/CSS, React, Node.js)</li> 
            </ul> 
     
           <p style="color: brown; justify-content: center; position: 
relative; left: 30px;"> In addition to my technical skills, I have strong 
communication and teamwork abilities, developed through collaborative projects 
and presentations during my academic tenure.  
     
            Furthermore, <br>I have completed internships at Sonic Solutions 
Company, where I gained practical experience in software development and 
contributed to the development of a new web application. 
     
            I am driven by a relentless pursuit <br> of excellence and 
continuous learning, seeking opportunities to collaborate with diverse teams, 
tackle complex problems, and drive impactful solutions that promote business 
growth and enhance customer satisfaction. <br> 
     
            My goal is to cultivate a fulfilling career path where I can 
continuously evolve, make a positive impact, and grow both personally and 
professionally, while making significant contributions to the success of the 
<br>organization I join.
